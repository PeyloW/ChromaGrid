### The Code

Code is split up into three main parts:

* MacOSHost - A macOS harness capable of running and debugging a simulated version pof the game
* ChromaGrid - The game!
* toybox - The reusable parts that could become many games
    * toystd - Minimal replacements for C++ standard library functionality, optimized for speed and space.

All code must compile with GCC 4.6.4 with c++0x _(Experimental C++11)_ enabled, no standard libraries linked.

 Make no assumption of integer/pointer size. macOS host uses 32 bit integers, target uses 16 bit integers. Whenever possible use explicitly sized types, `int16_t` not `short`.

Use static_asserts to ensure expected sizes for structs are correct. Asserts are enabled on macOS host, but not Atari target. Asserts are used liberly to ensure correctness.
    
Types uses suffix, variables does not:

* `_t` - POD, plain old type.
* `_e` - Enumeration.
* `_s` - Simple structs
    * Must never implement constructors or destructors.
    * For direct access to all members.
* `_c` - Classes
    * Classes __must__ support move semantics.
    * Never assume copy semantics are available.

#### Known libcmini limitations

libcmini-0.47 used is an older version form 2017, and has a few known issues. It is not being updated as to avoid disruptions before Sommarhack 2024.

* `fread` and `fwrite` does not return number of items, but total bytes on success.
* `rand()` does not respect `RAND_MAX` with -mshort, and can return negative values.
* `strncmp()` is just very buggy.

### File Format

#### `levels.dat` - An EA IFF 85 format

Same format is used for builtin levels and user levels. User levels may contain
a maximum of ten level forms.

```
// List of ChromaGrid LeVels
LIST # { CGLV       
    // Zero or more ChromaGrid LeVel forms
    FORM # { CGLV
        // Required LeVel HeaDer
        LVHD # {
            ubyte width
            ubyte height
            ubyte[2] orbs
            uword time
        }
        // Optional text
        TEXT # {
            string
        } ?
        // One or more Tile STateS, count defined by header width * height
        TSTS # {
            {
                ubyte type
                ubyte target
                ubyte current
                ubyte orb
            } +
        }
    } *
}
```

#### `scores.dat` - An EA IFF 85 format
If the number of scores chunks are less than available built in levels the 
remainders are all zero. Having more score chunks than evailable built in levels
is an error :/.

```
// List of ChromaGrid Level Scores
LIST # { CGLR       
    // Zero or more ChromaGrid Level Result chunks
    CGLR # {
        uword score
        ubyte[2] orbs
        uword time
        uword moves
    } *
}
```
