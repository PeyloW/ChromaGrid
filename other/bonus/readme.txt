Logic Square Preview November 1993
==================================

This is a previously unreleased preview
of the original game planned for a 1994
release. Gracefully shared by the 
original coder Peter 'Eagle' Nyman.

Apart from the name change the original
game has quite different gameplay:
 * Levels have a larger grid
 * Player has an unlimited amount of 
   orbs to place.
 * Orbs cannot be picked up once played
 * Empty space is filled when next to 
   two orbs
 * Player can exit by pressing F10.

Despite these changes 14 of the levels
could be converted and are included 
with minor modifications in the final
game.

This preview is in many ways more
scene-like. Having borders removed,
and many many raster splits. Thus
it requires an Atari 1040 STe.

Hope you enjoy this small time capsule.

Notes by the original author:
I made this game, Logic Square, after
some programming experiments with the
Atari ST/STE keyboard controller. I had
realized that the timing of the
interrupts from the keyboard controller
was much more predicable if set to
absolute mode instead of the default
relative mode. My initial ambition was
to make something never seen before; 
a mouse driven board game in 
fullscreen, with all borders removed, 
but in the end I never got the 
fullscreen code stable enough with the 
mouse active, and I had to settle with 
removing the upper and lower borders 
only. The highscore list is still in 
fullscreen.
