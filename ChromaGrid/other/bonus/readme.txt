Logic Square Preview November 1993
==================================

This is a previously unreleased preview
of the original game planned for a 1994
release. Gracefully shared by the 
original coder Peter 'Eagle' Nyman.

Apart from the name change the original
game has quite different gameplay:
 * Levels have a larger grid
 * Player has an unlimited amount of 
   orbs to place.
 * Orbs cannot be picked up once played
 * Empty space is filled when next to 
   two orbs

Despite these changes 14 of the levels
could be converted and are included 
with minor modifications in the final
game.

This preview is in many ways more
scene-like. Having borders removed,
and many many raster splits. Thus
it requires an Atari 1040 STe.

Hope you enjoy this small time capsule.
