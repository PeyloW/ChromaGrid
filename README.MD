### File Format

#### `levels.dat` - An EA IFF 85 format

Same format is used for builtin levels and user levels. User levels may contain
a maximum of ten level forms.

```
// List of ChromaGrid LeVels
LIST # { CGLV       
    // Zero or more ChromaGrid LeVel forms
    FORM # { CGLV
        // Required LeVel HeaDer
        LVHD # {
            ubyte width
            ubyte height
            ubyte[2] orbs
            uword time
        }
        // Optional text
        TEXT # {
            string
        } ?
        // One or more Tile STateS, count defined by header width * height
        TSTS # {
            {
                ubyte type
                ubyte target
                ubyte current
                ubyte orb
            } +
        }
    } *
}
```

#### `scores.dat` - An EA IFF 85 format
If the number of scores chunks are less than available built in levels the 
remainders are all zero. Having more score chunks than evailable built in levels
is an error :/.

```
// List of ChromaGrid Level Scores
LIST # { CGLR       
    // Zero or more ChromaGrid Level Result chunks
    CGLR # {
        ulong score
        ubyte[2] orbs
        uword time
        uword moves
    } *
}
```
